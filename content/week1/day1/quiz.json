        "var",
        "let",
        "let mut",
        "mut"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In Rust, `let mut` is used to declare a mutable variable. Variables are immutable by default, so you need the `mut` keyword to make them mutable.",

      "correct_answers": [0, 1, 3],
      "explanation": "Rust has signed (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128) and unsigned (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128) integer types. There is no generic 'int' type.",

        "init()"

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The `main()` function is the entry point of every Rust program. It's where execution begins.",
