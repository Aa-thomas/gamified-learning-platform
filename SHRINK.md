Perfect. We want something you can **recall under pressure**, when your brain blanks and your hand is hovering over ChatGPT.

Here’s the cleanest, most **sticky mnemonic** I know for this skill:

---

# **S.H.R.I.N.K. the Problem**

> **If your mind goes blank, the problem is too big.
> SHRINK it until it’s stupid.**

---

## 🧠 **S.H.R.I.N.K.**

### **S — State the goal**

**One sentence. No code.**

> “This function/system must ___.”

If you can’t say this, *stop*. You’re not allowed to code yet.

---

### **H — Hand me the inputs & outputs**

**Nouns only. No verbs.**

> Inputs:
> Outputs:

This collapses ambiguity instantly.

---

### **R — Rank the unknowns**

Ask:


> “What must be answered *first* for anything else to work?”

There is always one blocking question. Find it.

---

### **I — Implement the dumb version**

Write the **worst possible version**:

* big `match`
* TODO comments
* placeholder functions

Ugly code is thinking scaffolding.

---

### **N — Name the missing pieces**

Turn every `???` into a question:

* “What error do I return here?”
* “Is this state allowed?”
* “What data do I need?”

Each name = a solvable micro-problem.

---

### **K — Kill confusion with *targeted* AI**

AI is allowed **only now**, and only for:

* syntax help
* concept clarification
* error explanations

Never ask AI to solve the whole thing.

---

# 🔁 The Emergency Version (10 seconds)

When you panic, say this **out loud**:

> **“State it.
> Input/output it.
> Dumb it down.
> Name the holes.”**

That alone will unblock you most of the time.

---

# Why This Works (Important)

* **Blank mind ≠ lack of intelligence**
* **Blank mind = problem too large for working memory**

SHRINK forces:

* externalization (comments, notes),
* ordering (rank unknowns),
* and momentum (dumb code → real code).

This is exactly how senior engineers work—quietly, mechanically, without drama.

---

# The Rule You Must Obey

> **If you haven’t S.H.R.I.N.K.’d the problem,
> you are not allowed to ask AI for help.**

Print that. Put it in your repo README. Seriously.

---

If you want next, I can:

* turn this into a **one-page checklist** you paste at the top of every file, or
* apply **S.H.R.I.N.K. live** to a real Rust mini-challenge and show you how it feels in practice.

Just say which.
